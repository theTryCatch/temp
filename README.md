Technically, I'm already exceeding expectations, and maintaining this momentum seems adequate for my promotion from the technical point of view.

On the soft skills side, You've noticed some contradictions between my feedback points and my achievements. For instance, while I've been involved in helping others, and conducting training, whilst team members feel that I don't share my knowledge. We've discussed possible reasons for these contradicting opinions. However, you said that determining a concrete set of reasons for this has been challenging, especially since I wasn't part of those conversations. Nevertheless, we both agree that working from the same office could greatly improve the situation.

I've encountered a very common scenario that can arise often where team members approach me with technical challenges. Sometimes, my answers or guidance require fundamental knowledge that they might lack. In these cases, a few possibilities arise:

1. They seek further clarification on their knowledge gaps.
2. They might perceive my guidance as intentionally vague to avoid sharing knowledge instead of not realizing that need to learn the required fundamental topic(s) to solve the problem.
3. They feel uncomfortable asking about basic knowledge gaps, attributing their struggles to me.

You suggested a neutral approach, giving them space to think, and providing necessary materials without highlighting their lack of knowledge and not giving or writing the code itself. Additionally, I said that I gauge their interest based on their gestures, adjusting the depth of my explanations accordingly.

We discussed the potential benefits of having multiple team members work on a single project for some time. Specifically, I mentioned that while ECR is running stably, the current production version lacks full componentization. I proposed creating a new branch to work on making the code more maintainable. However, you suggested allowing Akanksha to complete her current assignment first, to which I agreed. Meanwhile, I expressed my intent to lay the groundwork for modularization.

I mentioned repeatedly that the only expectation I have from team members regarding unwavering support is their focus during discussions, displaying interest, and taking a bit of responsibility to solve problems. Under this condition, I don't mind explaining topics from the simplest to the most difficult. In fact, I'm more than happy to do so because I genuinely enjoy teaching.

When I asked about strategies for a successful team, you emphasized starting with something simpleâ€”encouraging everyone to participate actively in standups, turning on videos, engaging in conversations, and showcasing daily accomplishments rather than simply mentioning challenges faced.

You mentioned your focus this year is on team building and you are wiping my slate clean with this call, emphasizing that constructive feedback from you isn't a hindrance to my potential promotion next year. Additionally, you highlighted Pontillo's positivity regarding my promotion.

I also mentioned that in our biweekly 1:1 meetings, I would appreciate receiving feedback for myself. Additionally, if there's any urgent matter requiring immediate attention, I suggested having an ad-hoc meeting. Hence, I intend to inquire about my feedback during each call, regardless of whether you have any or not, to prevent the issues we had in 2023.
