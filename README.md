The EUT IMR team functions similarly to ECC at the WT level. Whenever they experience an outage, they must send timely notifications to a variety of stakeholders, with notification content tailored to each. Currently, they use iAnnounce, but as an announcement tool, it is inefficient for copying, pasting, and tracking incidents. Lakshmi provided an application called IMR NOMS, which effectively addresses all these issues as part of the MVP. It saves 15 minutes per update, compared to the 20 minutes previously required.
