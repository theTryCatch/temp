Over the past six months, I have noticed that Josh may benefit from some adjustments in his Teams and Outlook notification settings. It seems he can be somewhat selective in his written responses and, at times, does not acknowledge even 1:1 messages or emails. I believe this might be unintentional and could potentially be related to his notification settings.

In our interactions, I've observed that our conversations often tend to be heavily focused on technical discussions, making it challenging to gather feedback or insights. Perhaps he could consider preparing for one-on-one meetings by reviewing the team member's profile he is meeting with, which could make these sessions more productive and well-rounded.

While Josh is undoubtedly a technologist at heart, it would be beneficial for him to prioritize team management tasks as well. Over the past two years, I've noticed delays and occasional oversights in routine activities such as discussing annual goals, midyear evaluations, 360-degree evaluator discussions, and approvals. For instance, this year, we did not have a discussion about 360-degree evaluators, and he missed the approval deadline, resulting in auto-approval based on my selections.

Furthermore, it would greatly benefit the team if Josh could provide guidance on how team members can grow within the organization. Sharing insights on career development and pathways to advancement would contribute to our collective growth and motivation.

While Josh's eagerness to deliver quickly is commendable, it's crucial to stress the importance of revisiting code regularly to enhance its quality, as no software can be perfect upon initial delivery.

Additionally, he might consider setting clear expectations about deliverables with the team to minimize confusion and align our efforts more effectively.

Recognizing and acknowledging the accomplishments and breakthroughs of team members would also be highly motivating. Although being reserved about achievements might be a personal preference, in a workplace setting, positive recognition can significantly boost morale and motivation.

Lastly, it would be greatly appreciated if Josh could share more about the team's vision and alignment with organizational goals during higher-level management conversations. This would help us understand our collective direction and where we should focus our efforts.

I want to emphasize that this feedback is intended to enhance our team's overall effectiveness and foster a more open and collaborative work environment. I have the utmost respect for Josh's capabilities and look forward to continued growth and success.
