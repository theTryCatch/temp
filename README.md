Hi John,

I'm Santosh from the Platform Security team under Jay and Chris's organization. I joined Morgan Stanley in 2020 and have been involved in activities such as patching, EOL, and vulnerability issues, including expedited patching. I have a strong background in logical thinking and PowerShell scripting, which has allowed me to solve real-time problems effectively. I have contributed over a dozen features to the OCC Toolbox.

With these skills and experiences, I am keen to join Josh Levine's automation team. I believe this move will enhance my skill set and benefit the organization.

Please consider this email as my expression of interest in any open positions in your team, now or in the future.

Best regards,
Santosh
