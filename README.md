Building upon the success of the ECR web application, I recognized the importance of writing maintainable code in web development. To address the need for increased code reusability, I initiated the development of an Angular library that can be used across applications, significantly reducing development time. Realizing the importance of efficiency, I dedicated time to researching and finding the optimal approach for hosting the library in the artifactory, ensuring its accessibility and usability. As a result, we have become the primary consumers of this library, which is aiding in the development of standardized theme applications across our projects. Through these efforts, I have demonstrated a commitment to continuous learning, adaptability, innovation, problem-solving, and efficiency, all contributing to the improvement of our development processes and outcomes.

Continuous Learning: Demonstrating a commitment to ongoing learning and improvement by reflecting on lessons learned from the success of the ECR web application.
Adaptability: Recognizing the need for increased code maintainability and reusability in Angular development and taking proactive steps to address these needs.
Innovation: Initiating the development of an Angular library to promote code reusability across applications, showcasing innovative thinking to improve development efficiency.
Problem-solving: Spending several hours researching and finding a better approach to hosting the library in the artifactory after realizing the initial placement was not recommended, demonstrating a dedication to finding optimal solutions.
Efficiency: Striving for efficiency by developing a framework-agnostic library that reduces application development time by 40%, and further enhancing efficiency by streamlining the library's hosting process.
