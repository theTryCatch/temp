We have a subset of functionalities from the OCC Toolbox that are crucial for the daily tasks of a helpdesk agent. Initially, we decided to transform these functionalities into a web application even before the EUT and WSS merger was announced. At that time, the project was considered a low priority. However, after the WTS announcement, it became clear that duplicating efforts between EUT and WSS was inefficient. Consequently, we held several discussions and reached a consensus to provide APIs for their UI.

Within a short period, I was tasked with completing APIs for various systems including GMC, LDAP, BRAIN, and ServiceNow. I successfully finished all these APIs within a week and presented the proof of concept (POC) to the WS Agent Assist application development and SDM team members. This achievement was made possible due to our clear vision and strategic planning. The successful POC significantly boosted the confidence of both teams, demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach.
