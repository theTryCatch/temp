**Nomination for Award: Lakshmi**

Lakshmi has demonstrated remarkable efficiency in his contributions across multiple projects, significantly improving processes and outcomes for his team and organization.

### ECR Application Development

Lakshmi developed the ECR application to tackle key challenges in change request creation. Using TCM2 for this process was cumbersome for both requesters and reviewers, leading to frequent rejections. By identifying the main issues—incorrect approvers being selected and missing testing documents—Lakshmi created the ECR application, which eradicated these problems. In May 2024, the rejection rate for TCMs submitted using TCM2 was 36.27%, whereas for ECR it was only 24.59%, reflecting a significant efficiency improvement of around 10%.

### Implementation of Generic Web Application Patterns

Lakshmi's team works on a wide variety of web applications. He identified approximately 20 common implementation patterns and made them generic for reuse. These generics are now available as artifact packages. Previously, establishing a decent web application structure for new projects took about a month. With these packages, Lakshmi demonstrated that the same level of structure and aesthetics could be achieved in just 3 hours. This advancement has enhanced his efficiency and benefited the entire team.

### IMR NOMS Application for EUT IMR Team

The EUT IMR team, operating similarly to ECC at the WT level, faced inefficiencies when sending outage notifications and updates. They used iAnnounce, which required extensive copying and pasting. Lakshmi developed the IMR NOMS application, which addresses these issues. This new application reduces the time needed for each update from 20 minutes to just 5 minutes, saving significant time and improving overall efficiency.

### Development of REST APIs for LDAP Properties

WT operations teams frequently need to check LDAP properties for users, computers, proids, or groups. Existing tools were inadequate, especially for large groups, and required significant expertise to understand core AD object properties. Lakshmi developed REST APIs that provide easy access to FWD and AD LDAP properties. These APIs save up to 95% of the time previously required to obtain LDAP data, especially during outage investigations.

### Collaboration on Agent Assist Tool

Lakshmi is working with WS teams on the Agent Assist tool, intended for helpdesk agents during customer calls. Beyond providing APIs, Lakshmi divided the monolithic API into microservices, enhancing scalability and maintainability. This efficient approach ensures smoother operations and better performance of the tool.

### Conclusion

Lakshmi's contributions across these projects have significantly improved efficiency, reducing time and effort for various processes. His work exemplifies a strong commitment to enhancing individual and team performance, making him a deserving candidate for this award.
