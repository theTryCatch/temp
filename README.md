Mahesh possesses many admirable qualities, but there is an aspect that I believe deserves attention. In both formal and casual conversations, he sometimes exhibits a dominating demeanor, often insisting that his perspective and personal choices are superior to others'. This behavior has made it challenging for me to engage in casual conversations, as it frequently involves discussions about my personal life. I believe it's essential to respect individual choices and boundaries. For instance, during fun committee events where specific attire or participation is encouraged, Mahesh's reactions to those who choose not to participate can be less than accommodating. The same applies to late evening gatherings. It would be beneficial for Mahesh to recognize that not everyone's personal circumstances are the same, and some individuals may face unique challenges in participating. Every family's situation is different, and it's important to acknowledge that.

Furthermore, now with what I can sense from others, Mahesh appears to be more interested in non-core deliverables and seems to promote only those candidates who engage heavily in professional activities. This can inadvertently signal to the team that it's acceptable to prioritize non-technical goals over the core technical objectives, as long as it aligns with Mahesh's preferences.

I also want to acknowledge that my perspective might be influenced by the large number of employees reporting to Mahesh in Bengaluru. This environment seems to have fostered an unhealthy sense of competition and comparison among the team members, particularly regarding recognition and the promotion process.

I appreciate your understanding and support in addressing these concerns constructively. It's my intention to foster a positive and inclusive working environment where everyone's individuality and circumstances are respected.
