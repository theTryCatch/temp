OCC
    In addition to consistently meeting all OCC Toolbox feature requests within their designated timelines, I have actively pursued opportunities for innovation and continuous enhancement of our tools and processes as part of our daily operations. One noteworthy endeavor has been the implementation of foundational features aimed at improving productivity and user experience.

    Among these initiatives, a notable achievement has been the introduction of the capability to retrieve multiple results from a single computation, providing users with a more comprehensive and efficient solution. Furthermore, I have automated the output copying process, ensuring that users have immediate access to the results as soon as the execution is completed, streamlining workflow and saving valuable time.

MSModule
    Due to historical reasons, it was necessary to support the ability to import MSModule from the root folder along with its module files (.psm1 and .psd1). However, maintaining this feature has posed a significant overhead and introduced the risk of version mismatches. In response to this challenge, I have implemented a clever solution that not only eliminates the need for ongoing maintenance but also enhances the intelligence of the feature.

    With this improvement, the functionality we provide no longer requires any manual intervention to stay up-to-date. It has been designed to intelligently import the latest available version automatically. This strategic change was meticulously planned and executed seamlessly in the production environment, without causing any service disruptions, and accompanied by clear and timely announcements to ensure a smooth transition.

ECR
    Throughout this year, one of my primary focal points has undeniably centered around the ECR application. I recognized that developing the application itself, as well as hosting it in the recommended manner at Morgan Stanley, was the right course of action. Given that our team had limited experience with application hosting beyond Windeploy, I understood that continuing with that legacy was not the way forward. Consequently, I invested a substantial amount of my personal time and energy to identify and implement a more suitable hosting solution using Webstack2, which aligns with one of the preferred paths. Overcoming the challenges of both hosting the web application and successfully deploying it into production were significant milestones.

    In addition to this accomplishment:

    1. I delivered the cloning and editing features.
    2. I enabled the ability to browse and add VMS and Jira integrations.
    3. The implementation of an SQL database was successfully completed, providing us with valuable insights into the list of TCMs raised using the ECR application.
    4. Upon the application's production launch, I proactively collected and addressed numerous feedback items. I approached these challenges with the utmost priority, striving to maintain the trust of ECR consumers. As a result I received expressions of appreciation from ECR consumers for my swift responses.

WintoolsAPI
    With utmost sincerity, I can proudly declare that WintoolsAPI stands as a testament to my innovative ideas and is now a tangible reality in our production environment. This API has rapidly proven its worth, serving as a key tool in addressing numerous challenges in ECR application context while simultaneously opening the door to exciting new opportunities such as EUT Workbench. Its strategic significance lies in its capacity to enable the creation of a sustainable and maintainable ecosystem, aligiing with our long-term visions.

EUTWorkbench
    Remaining at the forefront of technology is an imperative that sets you apart from others, and this principle extends to computer applications, including OCC Toolbox. In line with this ethos, I am actively engaged in the development of EUTWorkbech, a web application iteration of OCC Toolbox, with a target completion date set for the end of October 2023. EUTWorkbech empowers authenticated and authorized users to perform tasks seamlessly, eliminating the need to access a jump server for operations.

    One of the notable features I've been working on is the capability for the CLH chapter to efficiently manage ECR squad approvers. In this context, WintoolsAPI serves as the soul of our operations, while EUTWorkbech acts as its tangible embodiment, representing the harmonious synergy of innovation and practicality in our evolving technology landscape.

EUT PMGT Docs
    This is another ambitious project that I have envisioned and am diligently working to bring to fruition. To date, I have successfully completed a proof of concept (POC) where documentation is structured in markdown files, and this dynamic website renders the content seamlessly. Additionally, this site will serve as a fleet-level platform, enabling each chapter to independently showcase their documentation, providing valuable insights into their respective chapters, tools, and more.

Contributions outside of my team

    MSDE Project
        I wholeheartedly embrace the vision of the MSDE team to create a tool that empowers anyone to seamlessly perform prerequisites checkouts for various setups, facilitating a smoother onboarding experience for new developers at Morgan Stanley. I am actively contributing to turning this vision into reality. Thus far, I have successfully delivered an MVP version of a PowerShell script that conducts these checkouts. Currently, my focus is on integrating this functionality into our WintoolsAPI and implementing a user-friendly interface within EUTWorkbech.

        This proactive effort not only expands our capabilities but also enhances our brand's visibility and reputation.

    Skype/ Teams projects
    During a casual conversation with Mr. Pradeep, a Microsoft Teams SME, over lunch, I identified two significant opportunities for automation within their domain.

    Firstly, I undertook the modernization of a decade-old automation process that plays a crucial role in making strategic decisions during user migrations from Skype to Teams. The previous automation was not only time-consuming but also highly variable, often taking 8+ hours to complete, and sometimes extending to days. Through my efforts, I managed to streamline this process, reducing the execution time to an impressive 1 hour and 30 minutes.

    Secondly, I introduced a more intelligent approach to apply IM audio and video policies for China-based users during onboarding and offboarding procedures. Previously, applying these policies manually would consume around 3 minutes per user. My automation solution significantly expedited this task, enhancing efficiency and reducing the manual workload.

    These improvements reflect my commitment to finding innovative solutions that optimize our operations and save valuable time and resources.


I consistently exceed expectations through my proactive approach to innovation and problem-solving across various projects. From optimizing tool functionality to streamlining automation processes, I consistently deliver impactful results that enhance efficiency and user experience. My commitment to excellence extends beyond my team, contributing to the organization's success and reputation.

-------- >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> ----------

In reflecting on my contributions this year, I confidently rate myself as exceeding expectations.

    In the realm of PowerShell training, I took the initiative to conceive and organize a program that significantly benefited our cross-functional teams. Collaborating with two trainers, I not only orchestrated a successful training initiative but also provided valuable project mentoring to four trainees. This commitment spanned over 100 hours and resulted in some projects progressing to production. Furthermore, my role in promoting OCC Toolbox led to the onboarding of a new feature, initiated by one of our trainees, enhancing our team's overall progress and branding.

    Regarding GVM activities, I dedicated over 7 hours to support these initiatives. Additionally, my involvement in the photography club, where I captured professional photos for various EUT events, including James Cherubini's visit to India, underscored my commitment to contributing beyond the scope of my role.

    These achievements exemplify my proactive approach, dedication to team growth, and the ability to empower others, all of which have consistently exceeded expectations and positively impacted our team's success and reputation.
