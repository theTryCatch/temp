Santosh is undoubtedly equipped with sound technical knowledge, which has been a significant asset to our team. His expertise in areas like PowerShell, SCCM, and SQL has been instrumental in delivering successful solutions.

However, it's worth mentioning that there are some areas where there may be opportunities for improvement. While Santosh's current demeanor and disposition are entirely in line with his nature, it could be beneficial if he could find moments to wear a smile more often. It's important to acknowledge that his current demeanor may be influenced by personal life experiences, which I have no right to comment on.

Santosh has, at times, expressed dissatisfaction regarding colleagues, processes, and certain rumors about him. In such situations, it would be advisable for him to consider addressing these concerns through appropriate channels. This might include discussing matters with his immediate manager or escalating them to higher-level managers who can facilitate resolution.

Additionally, I would strongly recommend that Santosh consider becoming a part of a program like Toastmasters. This program could significantly enhance his skills in intent expression and effective communication, further amplifying his contributions within the team.

Furthermore, I encourage Santosh to start building his professional profile, leveraging his extensive knowledge in PowerShell, SCCM, and SQL. This proactive step can open up new avenues for growth within the organization and provide opportunities to contribute to teams beyond his current squad.

In conclusion, Santosh's technical prowess and dedication to our organization are undeniable. With some minor adjustments and by embracing these suggestions, he can continue to excel and further enhance his impact on our projects and team dynamics.
