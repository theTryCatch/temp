Good evening, everyone.

Today, I'm thrilled to have this opportunity to swiftly highlight the incredible journey and achievements of our DO-IT program, all achieved through the power of PowerShell.

Just to give quick intro about DO-IT, this program is to cultivate a DevOps mindset by impowering trainees with PowerShell proficiency to bridge knowledge gaps hindering business impacting projects.

This marks my third consecutive year leading the PowerShell training, and this year stands out with a slightly different approach. Over 100 hours were dedicated to training, project guidance, management, and mentorship.

Unlike previous years, our emphasis this year was on culminating the program with a real-time project closure, ensuring that trainees demonstrate their skills in practical application.

Without surprise, I'm proud to showcase the top 5 trainees and their project details. These projects stand as a testament to the impactful outcomes of our program, showcasing admirable work with significant business impact.

Each project shares a common focus: reducing manual efforts while introducing valuable aspects such as outage prevention, hygiene, and compliance. It's evident that these initiatives aim not just for efficiency but also for essential improvements across various aspects of our operations.

Thank you for allowing me to present this snapshot of our achievements within a short timeframe. Our DO-IT program continues to foster innovation and impactful solutions, powered by the dedication and expertise of our trainees.
