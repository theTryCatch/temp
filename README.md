Driven by a passion for teaching and a desire to innovate, I recognized the need to revamp PowerShell training with a fresh approach. Understanding the importance of tangible outcomes, I collaborated with candidates' managers to align training objectives with real-world projects. Despite the challenge of accommodating candidates with varying levels of PowerShell knowledge, I found the right balance to keep the program engaging and effective. Serving as a mentor for five candidates and managing two project mentors, I led the program with enthusiasm and dedication, ensuring that each participant gained valuable skills and experiences to apply in their roles. Through this initiative, I not only fostered individual growth but also contributed to the overall development and success of the team.
