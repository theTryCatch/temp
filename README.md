Good evening, everyone.

Today, I'm thrilled to have this opportunity to swiftly highlight the incredible journey and achievements of our DO-IT program, all achieved through the power of PowerShell.

Just to give quick intro about DO-IT, this program is to cultivate a DevOps mindset by empowering trainees with PowerShell proficiency to bridge knowledge gaps hindering business impacting projects.

This marks my third consecutive year leading the PowerShell training, and this year stands out with a slightly different approach. Over 100 hours were dedicated to training, project guidance, management, and mentorship.

Unlike previous years, our emphasis this year was on culminating the program with a real-time project closure, ensuring that trainees demonstrate their skills in practical application.

Without surprise, I'm proud to showcase the top 5 trainees and their project details. These projects stand as a testament to the impactful outcomes of our program, showcasing admirable work with significant business impact.

Each project shares a common focus: reducing manual efforts while introducing valuable aspects such as outage prevention, hygiene, and compliance. It's evident that these initiatives aim not just for efficiency but also for essential improvements across various aspects of our operations.

Let me give a quick brief of each project and their impact.

Santosh completed a project on Windows 10 rebuild prerequisite checks, reducing toil by 98% per machine while ensuring plant hygiene.

Gautam tackled SCOM proids passwords rotation, syncing with Cyberarc passwords for M365 system ids, reducing toil by 80% monthly.

Dinesh automated Windows 11 OS upgrade deployments, currently achieving 98% toil reduction, with potential future benefits.

Sandeepan addressed invalid server work windows, reducing toil by 98% per month and ensuring compliance adherence.

Lastly, Nagendra's SCCM project identifies and cleans up stale application deployments, resulting in a 90% toil reduction per month.

With that said, thank you for allowing me to present this snapshot of our achievements within a short timeframe. Our DO-IT program continues to foster innovation and impactful solutions, powered by the dedication and expertise of our trainees.
